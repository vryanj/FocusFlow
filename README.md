## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### AI Features Setup (Optional but Recommended)
FocusFlow's AI task breakdown feature requires a Google Gemini API key:

1. **Get Your Free API Key**
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/quickstart)
   - Create a new project and get your API key (free tier available)

   - Open the app and click the menu (‚ò∞) ‚Üí Settings
   - Enter your API key
