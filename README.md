## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. (Optional) Add your Google Gemini API key via Settings menu for AI features
4. Start focusing and earning credits!

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Set Your Task** - Enter what you want to work on
2. **Generate Subtasks** - Use AI to break down complex tasks (requires API key)
3. **Start Timer** - Choose your preferred Pomodoro duration
4. **Earn Credits** - Complete sessions to earn credits
5. **Spend Rewards** - Use credits on custom break activities
6. **Track Progress** - View your productivity history and stats

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Google Gemini API Setup (Optional)
For AI-powered task breakdown:

1. Open the Settings menu (hamburger menu → Settings)
2. Get your free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/quickstart)
3. Enter your API key in the settings
4. Your key is stored locally and never shared

The app works perfectly without an API key - you just won't have AI task generation.

### Customization
- Add your own reward perks
- Adjust timer durations
- Customize themes and colors
